                Rombel: PPLG X-3<br>Rayon: Cicurug 9<br>Hobby: Listening To Music<br>

            About Me<br>My hobby is listening to Taylor Swift's music. I like all of her songs. Besides Taylor, I also enjoy Nadin Amizah's songs. Maybe all of her songs are my favorites, but the ones I listen to most frequently are 'Taruh,' 'Beranjak Dewasa,' and 'Sorai'; they're really enjoyable. I'm also a fan of the idol group JKT48, yes, I'm a wota who follows them on social media. I love listening to their songs and watching their Showrooms or theater performances. Their songs may not be everyone's cup of tea, but if you're a wota, you'll definitely like them. My favorite members (oshi) are many: Zee, Marsha, Muthe, Christy, Shani.<br>

            Apart from music, I also watch Ghibli movies. Almost all of them have been watched, and 'When Marnie Was There' is the best because of its plot twist. There are probably many other good ones, but that's about it.

            <br>

            I was born in 2008 and live with both of my parents and my family in Cigombong. I'm the youngest of four siblings, with two older brothers and one older sister. Besides music, what I like the most is probably the sky; 'the sky is beautiful, isn't it,' they say. Besides the sky, I also like outer space and planets; they're just so cool.

            <br>

            My profession is being a comedian or an entertainer, always trying to lighten the mood. My friends say that I'm friendly and sociable, but I guess it's true, haha. But behind all that friendliness, it makes me happy because it helps me make many acquaintances at school, almost in every department, even if we're not very close, just knowing their names. I go to an SMK (Vocational High School) located in the eastern part of Bogor called SMK WIKRAMA. I'm in the 10th grade, majoring in PPLG (Software and Game Development). I'm always friendly when greeting anyone. That's about it. Thank you."</p>
